Xploitable modifies your Linux kernel.

If you thought it was impossible, it's actually easy! Pull up your terminal,
download an Xploitable modification, and open it.

## Warning!

Xploitable does not take care of the kernel. After installing a modification,
the system may no longer be bootable. If you can still boot the Linux Kernel after
installing a module, it is possible something is different, that your warranty
is now void (if your PC came with a Linux-based OS), and you are attempting security
loss. If you are worried about a bricked system, do not install Xploitable.
